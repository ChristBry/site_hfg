                        <p className='text-justify'>
                            As global mobility becomes a cornerstone of economic growth, Africa is boldly embracing the future
                            with one of its most ambitious initiatives yet: the Single African Air Transport Market (SAATM).
                            Launched under the African Union's Agenda 2063, 2024 marks a turning point in regional integration
                            with the gradual rollout of SAATM—a bold vision for a unified, liberalized airspace across the continent.

                    <p>
                        The Single African Air Transport Market is a flagship project aimed at removing restrictions on air transport between
                        African countries. It promotes:
                    </p>
                    <ol className='list-disc'>
                        <li>Open skies for African airlines</li>
                        <li>Increased intra-African connectivity</li>
                        <li>More affordable airfares for passengers</li>
                        <li>Boosted tourism, trade, and economic collaboration</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        For decades, Africa’s aviation potential has been limited by fragmented airspace, protectionist policies, and high travel costs.
                        SAATM promises to change that.
                    </p>
                    <h4 className='text-2xl font-bold'>Why It Matters for African Aviation</h4>
                    <p>
                        With SAATM, African airlines can operate freely across member countries without the need for special permissions or bilateral agreements.
                        This is a game-changer for:
                    </p>
                    <ol className='list-disc'>
                        <li>Business travel and logistics, thanks to easier access between economic hubs</li>
                        <li>Tourism, with smoother inter-country routes and fewer layovers</li>
                        <li>Employment, by stimulating growth in the aviation sector and related industries</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        In essence, SAATM has the potential to turn Africa into one large domestic market, unlocking the full value of its skies.
                    </p>
                    <h4 className='text-2xl font-bold'>Towards a More Connected Continent</h4>
                    <p>
                        A unified airspace will not only enhance economic development but also foster greater unity among African nations. By flying more,
                        trading more, and connecting more, Africa is positioning itself to compete globally with stronger infrastructure and regional collaboration.
                        However, success will depend on political will, regulatory alignment, and infrastructure investment. It’s a long journey, but the direction is right.
                    </p>
                    <h4 className='text-2xl font-bold'>Flying into the Future</h4>
                    <p>
                        As 2024 unfolds, African aviation enters a transformative phase. SAATM is more than just policy—it’s a symbol of a shared future. A future where the skies
                        are no longer barriers but bridges. A future where a student in Dakar can easily attend a conference in Nairobi, or an entrepreneur in Kigali can explore
                        opportunities in Lagos.
